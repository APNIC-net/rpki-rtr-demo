   The Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) to Router Protocol,
                               Version 2
                     draft-ietf-sidrops-8210bis-24

Abstract

   In order to validate the origin Autonomous Systems (ASes) and
   Autonomous System relationships behind BGP announcements, routers
   need a simple but reliable mechanism to receive Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RFC6480) prefix origin data, Router Keys, and ASPA
   data from a trusted cache.  This document describes a protocol to
   deliver them.

   This document describes version 2 of the RPKI-Router protocol.
   [RFC6810] describes version 0, and [RFC8210] describes version 1.
   This document is compatible with both.

1.  Introduction

   In order to verifiably validate the origin Autonomous Systems (ASes)
   and AS paths of BGP announcements, routers need a simple but reliable
   mechanism to receive cryptographically validated Resource Public Key
   Infrastructure (RPKI) [RFC6480] prefix origin data, Router Keys, and
   ASPA data from a trusted cache.  This document describes a protocol
   to deliver them.  The design is intentionally constrained to be
   usable on much of the current generation of ISP router platforms.

   This specification documents version 2 of the RPKI-RTR protocol.
   Earlier versions are documented in [RFC6810] and [RFC8210].  Though
   this version is, of course, preferred, the earlier versions are
   expected to continue to be productively deployed indefinitely, and
   Section 7 details how to downgrade from this version to earlier
   versions as needed in order to interoperate.

   Section 3 describes the deployment structure, and Section 4 then
   presents an operational overview.  The binary payloads of the
   protocol are formally described in Section 5, and the expected
   Protocol Data Unit (PDU) sequences are described in Section 8.  The
   transport protocol options are described in Section 9.  Section 10
   details how routers and caches are configured to connect and
   authenticate.  The traditional security and IANA considerations end
   the document.

   The protocol is extensible in order to support new PDUs with new
   semantics, if deployment experience indicates that they are needed.
   PDUs are versioned should deployment experience call for change.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.2.  Changes from RFC8210

   This section summarizes the significant changes between [RFC8210] and
   the protocol described in this document.

   *  A new ASPA (Autonomous System Provider Authorization) PDU type
      (Section 5.12) has been added to support
      [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile].

   *  Section 11 has been added in order to handle race conditions, by
      mandating a payload PDU ordering for caches and documenting
      related client implementation options.

   *  Language was clarified when multiple caches are configured, and an
      interesting affect is noted.

   *  The protocol version number incremented from 1 (one) to 2 (two)
      and Section 7 on Protocol Version Negotiation has been updated
      accordingly.

   *  Limits the maximum size of a PDU to 64k.

2.  Glossary

   The following terms are used with special meaning.

   Global RPKI:  The authoritative data of the RPKI are published in a
      distributed set of servers at the IANA, Regional Internet
      Registries (RIRs), National Internet Registries (NIRs), and ISPs;
      see [RFC6481].

   CA:  The authoritative data of the RPKI are meant to be published by
      a distributed set of Certification Authorities (CAs) at the IANA,
      RIRs, NIRs, and ISPs (see [RFC6481]).

   Cache:  A Cache, AKA Relying Party Cache, is a coalesced copy of the







Bush, et al.             Expires 11 August 2026                 [Page 4]

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


      published Global RPKI data, periodically fetched or refreshed,
      directly or indirectly, using the rsync protocol [RFC5781] or some
      successor.  Relying Party software is used to gather and validate
      the distributed data of the RPKI into a cache.  Trusting this
      cache further is a matter between the provider of the cache and a
      Relying Party.

   Serial Number:  "Serial Number" is a 32-bit strictly increasing
      unsigned integer which wraps from 2^32-1 to 0.  See [RFC1982] on
      DNS Serial Number Arithmetic for too much detail on serial number
      wrapping.  The Serial Number denotes the logical version of a
      cache.  A cache increments the value when it successfully updates
      its data from a parent cache or from primary RPKI data.  While a
      cache is receiving updates, new incoming data and implicit deletes
      are associated with the new Serial Number but MUST NOT be sent
      until the fetch is complete.  A Serial Number is not commensurate
      between different caches or different protocol versions, nor need
      it be maintained across resets of the cache server.

   Session ID:  When a cache server starts a new Sequence Number space,
      (which might be caused by, for example, restart with loss of data)
      it generates a new Session ID to uniquely identify the instance of
      the cache and to bind it to the sequence of Serial Numbers that
      the cache instance generates.  This allows a router to resume a
      session after a transport connection failure without invalidating
      the router's data store; as it is assured that the Serial Numbers
      it uses are commensurate with those of the cache.

   Payload PDU:  A payload PDU is a protocol message which contains data
      for use by the router, as opposed to a PDU which conveys the
      control mechanisms of this protocol.  IPvX Prefixes, Router Keys,
      ASPA are examples of payload PDUs.

3.  Deployment Structure

   Deployment of the RPKI to reach routers has a three-level structure
   as follows:

   Global RPKI:  The authoritative data of the RPKI are published in a
      distributed set of servers at the IANA, RIRs, NIRs, and ISPs (see
      [RFC6481]).

   Local Caches:  Local caches are a local set of one or more collected
      and verified caches of RPKI data.  A Relying Party, e.g., router
      or other client, MUST have a trust relationship with, and a
      trusted transport channel to, any cache(s) it uses.

   Routers:  A router fetches data from a local cache using the protocol



Bush, et al.             Expires 11 August 2026                 [Page 5]

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


      described in this document.  It is said to be a client of the
      cache.  There MAY be mechanisms for the router to assure itself of
      the authenticity of the cache and to authenticate itself to the
      cache (see Section 9).

4.  Operational Overview

   A router establishes and keeps open a transport connection to one or
   more caches with which it has client/server relationships.  It is
   configured with a semi-ordered list of caches and establishes a
   connection to the most preferred cache, or set of caches with that
   same priority, which accept the connections.

   The router MUST choose the most preferred, by configuration, cache or
   set of caches so that the operator may control load on their caches
   and the Global RPKI.

   A Validated ROA Payload (VRP, see [RFC6811]) is effective if it is in
   the fetched set from any of the currently preferred caches.
   Therefore, a VRP takes effect on the router when the first cache
   serves that VRP, and the VRP is in effect until the last cache
   withdraws that VRP.  Thus, in a global sense, the effect of a VRP
   announcement propagates more quickly than a withdraw.

   Periodically, the router sends a Serial Query to the cache specifying
   the most recent Serial Number for which it has received data from
   that cache, i.e., the router's current Serial Number for that cache,
   in the form of a Serial Query.  When a router establishes a new
   session with a cache or wishes to reset a current relationship, it
   sends a Reset Query.

   The cache responds to the Serial Query with all data changes which
   took place since the given Serial Number.  This may be the null set,
   in which case the End of Data PDU (Section 5.8) is still sent.  Note
   that the Serial Number comparison used to determine "since the given
   Serial Number" MUST take wrap-around into account; see [RFC1982].

   When the router receives an End of Data PDU, it has received all
   current data from the cache.  It then sets its current Serial Number
   for that cache to that of the Serial Number in the received End of
   Data PDU.

   When the cache updates its database, it sends a Notify PDU to every
   currently connected router.  This is a hint that now would be a good
   time for the router to poll for an update, but it is only a hint.
   The protocol requires the router to poll for updates periodically in
   any case.

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


   Strictly speaking, a router could track a cache simply by asking for
   a complete data set every time it updates, but this would be very
   inefficient.  The Serial-Number-based incremental update mechanism
   allows an efficient transfer of just the data records which have
   changed since the last update.  As with any update protocol based on
   incremental transfers, the router must be prepared to fall back to a
   full transfer if for any reason the cache is unable to provide the
   necessary incremental data.  Unlike some incremental transfer
   protocols, this protocol requires the router to make an explicit
   request to start the fallback process; this is deliberate, as the
   cache has no way of knowing whether the router has also established
   sessions with other caches that may be able to provide better
   service.

   As cache servers must evaluate signed objects (see [RFC6480]) with
   time dependent validity periods, servers' clocks MUST be correct
   within a tolerance of an hour.

   Barring errors, transport connections remain up as long as the cache
   and router remain up and the router is not reconfigured to no longer
   use the cache.

   Should a transport connection be lost for unknown reasons, the router
   SHOULD try to reestablish one; being careful to not abuse the cache
   with two many failed requests.

5.  Protocol Data Units (PDUs)

   The exchanges between the cache and the router are sequences of
   exchanges of the following PDUs according to the rules described in
   Section 8.

   Reserved fields (marked "zero" in PDU diagrams) MUST be zero on
   transmission and MUST be ignored on receipt.

5.1.  Fields of a PDU

   PDUs contain the following data elements:

   Protocol Version:  An 8-bit unsigned integer, currently 2, denoting
      the version of this protocol.

   PDU Type:  An 8-bit unsigned integer, denoting the type of the PDU,
      e.g., Type 4, IPv4 Prefix.

   Serial Number:  A 32-bit unsigned integer serializing the RPKI cache





Bush, et al.             Expires 11 August 2026                 [Page 7]

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


      epoch when this set of PDUs was received from an upstream cache
      server or gathered from the Global RPKI.  A cache increments its
      Serial Number when completing a validated update from a parent
      cache or the Global RPKI.

   Session ID:  A 16-bit unsigned integer.  When a cache server is
      [re]started (i.e. its data are not a continuation of the previous
      data) it generates a new Session ID to identify the instance of
      the cache and to bind it to the sequence of Serial Numbers that
      cache instance will generate.  This allows the router to restart a
      failed session knowing that the Serial Number it is using is
      commensurate with that of the cache.

      The cache informs the router of the Session ID by way of a Cache
      Response.  From that point, for the duration of the session, both
      the router and the cache must use that Session ID in all PDUs that
      contain a Session ID, unless the router sends a Reset Query, in
      which case the cache may respond with a Cache Response containing
      a new Session ID.  If either the router or the cache finds that
      the value of the Session ID it is using is not the same as the
      other's in accordance with the behaviour in this paragraph, the
      party which detects the mismatch MUST immediately terminate the
      session with an Error Report PDU with code 0 ("Corrupt Data"), and
      the router MUST flush all data learned from that cache.

      Note that sessions are specific to a particular protocol version.
      That is, if a cache server which supports multiple versions of
      this protocol happens to use the same Session ID value for
      multiple protocol versions, and further happens to use the same
      Serial Number values for two or more sessions using the same
      Session ID but different Protocol Version values, the Serial
      Numbers are not commensurate.  The full test for whether Serial
      Numbers are commensurate requires comparing Protocol Version,
      Session ID, and Serial Number.  To reduce the risk of confusion,
      cache servers SHOULD NOT use the same Session ID across multiple
      protocol versions, but even if they do, routers MUST treat
      sessions with different Protocol Version fields as separate
      sessions even if they do happen to have the same Session ID.

      Should a cache erroneously reuse a Session ID so that a router
      does not realize that the session has changed (old Session ID and
      new Session ID have the same numeric value), the router may become
      confused as to the content of the cache.  The time it takes the
      router to discover this will depend on whether the Serial Numbers
      are also reused.  If the Serial Numbers in the old and new
      sessions are different enough, the cache will respond to the
      router's Serial Query with a Cache Reset, which will solve the
      problem.  If, however, the Serial Numbers are close, the cache may

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


      respond with a Cache Response, which may not be enough to bring
      the router into sync.  In such cases, it's likely but not certain
      that the router will detect some discrepancy between the state
      that the cache expects and its own state.  For example, the Cache
      Response may tell the router to drop a record which the router
      does not hold or may tell the router to add a record which the
      router already has.  In such cases, a router will detect the error
      and reset the session.  The one case in which the router may stay
      out of sync is when nothing in the Cache Response contradicts any
      data currently held by the router.

      Using persistent storage for the Session ID or a clock-based
      scheme for generating Session IDs should avoid the risk of Session
      ID collisions.

      The Session ID might be a pseudorandom value, a strictly
      increasing value if the cache has reliable storage, et cetera.  A
      seconds-since-epoch timestamp value such as the low order 16 bits
      of unsigned integer seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z ignoring
      leap seconds might make a good Session ID value.

   Length:  A 32-bit unsigned integer which has as its value the count
      of the octets in the entire PDU, including the 8 octets of header
      which includes the length field.  This length MUST NOT exceed
      65,535 octets.  Note that BGP speakers already need the capability
      to handle messages of this size, see [RFC8654].

   Flags:  An 8-bit binary field, with the lowest-order bit being 1 for
      an announcement and 0 for a withdrawal.  For a Prefix PDU (IPv4 or
      IPv6), the announce/withdraw flag indicates whether this PDU
      announces a new right to announce the prefix or withdraws a
      previously announced right; a withdraw effectively deletes one
      previously announced Prefix PDU with the exact same Prefix,
      Length, Max-Len, and Autonomous System Number (AS).

      Similarly, for a Router Key PDU, the flag indicates whether this
      PDU announces a new Router Key or deletes a previously announced
      Router Key PDU with the exact same AS Number,
      subjectKeyIdentifier, and subjectPublicKeyInfo.

      Similarly, for an ASPA PDU, the flag indicates a new or
      replacement mapping of the specified Customer AS to a set of
      Provider ASes or the removal of the existant mapping.

      The remaining bits in the Flags field are reserved for future use.

   Prefix Length:  An 8-bit unsigned integer denoting the shortest
      prefix allowed by the Prefix element.

   Max Length:  An 8-bit unsigned integer denoting the longest prefix
      allowed by the Prefix element.  This MUST NOT be less than the
      Prefix Length element.

   Prefix:  The IPv4 or IPv6 prefix of the ROA.

   Autonomous System Number:  A 32-bit unsigned integer representing an
      AS allowed to announce a prefix, associated with a Router Key, or
      ASPA Customer or Provider.

   Subject Key Identifier:  The 20-octet Subject Key Identifier (SKI)
      value of a router key, as described in [RFC6487].

   Subject Public Key Info:  A variable length field holding a Router
      Key's subjectPublicKeyInfo value, as described in [RFC8608].  This
      is the full ASN.1 DER encoding of the subjectPublicKeyInfo,
      including the ASN.1 tag and length values of the
      subjectPublicKeyInfo SEQUENCE.

   Refresh Interval:  A 32-bit interval in seconds between normal cache
      polls.  See Section 6.

   Retry Interval:  A 32-bit interval in seconds between cache poll
      retries after a failed cache poll.  See Section 6.

   Expire Interval:  A 32-bit interval in seconds during which data
      fetched from a cache remains valid in the absence of a successful
      subsequent cache poll.  See Section 6.

   Customer Autonomous System Number:  The 32-bit AS number of the
      Autonomous System that authorizes the upstream providers listed in
      the Provider Autonomous System list to propagate prefixes to other
      ASes.

   Provider Autonomous System Numbers:  The set of 32-bit AS numbers
      authorized to propagate prefixes which were received from the
      customer AS.

   The cache notifies the router that the cache has new data.

   The Session ID reassures the router that the Serial Numbers are
   commensurate, i.e., the cache session has not been changed.

   Upon receipt of a Serial Notify PDU, the router MAY issue an
   immediate Serial Query (Section 5.3) or Reset Query (Section 5.4)
   without waiting for the Refresh Interval timer (see Section 6) to
   expire.

   Serial Notify is the only message that the cache MAY send that is not
   in response to a message from the router.

   If the router receives a Serial Notify PDU during the initial startup
   period where the router and cache are still negotiating to agree on a
   protocol version, the router MUST simply ignore the Serial Notify
   PDU, even if the Serial Notify PDU is for an unexpected protocol
   version.  See Section 7 for details.

   The router sends a Serial Query to ask the cache for all
   announcements and withdrawals which have occurred since the Serial
   Number specified in the Serial Query.

   The cache replies to this query with a Cache Response PDU
   (Section 5.5) if the cache has a (possibly null) record of the
   changes since the Serial Number specified by the router, followed by
   zero or more payload PDUs and an End Of Data PDU (Section 5.8).

   When replying to a Serial Query, the cache MUST return the minimum
   set of changes needed to bring the router into sync with the cache.
   That is, if a particular prefix, Router Key, or ASPA underwent
   multiple changes between the Serial Number specified by the router
   and the cache's current Serial Number, the cache MUST merge those
   changes to present the simplest possible view of those changes to the
   router.  In general, this means that, for any particular prefix/AS,
   Router Key. or ASPA/Customer, the data stream will include at most
   one withdrawal followed by at most one announcement, and if all of
   the changes cancel out, the data stream will not mention the prefix/
   AS, Router Key, or ASPA/Customer at all.

   In the data responding to a Serial Query, should the router receive
   duplicate announcements or withdrawals, the router should raise an
   Error with Error Code 7, Duplicate Announcement Received.

   The rationale for this approach is that the entire purpose of the
   RPKI-Router protocol is to offload work from the router to the cache,
   and it should therefore be the cache's job to simplify the change
   set, thus reducing work for the router.

   If the cache does not have the data needed to update the router, then
   it responds with a Cache Reset PDU (Section 5.9).  There are two main
   scenarios where this will happen: when the Serial Number requested in

   the Serial Query is no longer available to the cache, and when the
   session ID in the Serial Query designates a session that is no longer
   available to the cache.

   Per section 5.1, if the Serial Query contains a session ID that is
   not equal to that previously established in the session between the
   router and the cache, the cache terminates the session with an Error
   Report PDU with code 0 ("Corrupt Data").  The behaviour in the second
   scenario from the previous paragraph is limited to two cases: where
   the router is using the previously-established session ID, and where
   the cache is unable to determine whether the router is using the
   previously-established session ID, due to data loss or similar.

   The router tells the cache that it wants to receive the total active,
   current, non-withdrawn database.  The cache responds with a Cache
   Response PDU (Section 5.5), followed by zero or more payload PDUs and
   an End of Data PDU (Section 5.8).

   current with all changes that have occurred since the Serial Number

   sent by the client router.  When replying to a Reset Query
   (Section 5.4), the cache sends the set of all data records it has; in
   this case, the announce/withdraw field in the payload PDUs MUST have
   the value 1 (announce).

   In response to a Reset Query, the new value of the Session ID tells
   the router the instance of the cache session for future confirmation.
   In response to a Serial Query, the Session ID being the same
   reassures the router that the Serial Numbers are commensurate, i.e.,
   the cache session has not been changed.

   This PDU carries a VRP for an IPv4 ROA [RFC6811].

   The lowest-order bit of the Flags field is 1 for an announcement and
   0 for a withdrawal.

   In the RPKI, there is an actual need for what might appear to a
   router as identical IPvX PDUs.  This can occur when an upstream
   certificate is being reissued or there is an address ownership
   transfer up the validation chain.  The ROA would be identical in the
   router sense, i.e., have the same {Prefix, Len, Max-Len, AS}, but it
   would have a different validation path in the RPKI.  This is
   important to the RPKI but not to the router.

   The cache server MUST ensure that it has told the router client to
   have one and only one IPvX VRP for a unique {Prefix, Len, Max-Len,
   AS} at any one point in time.  Should the router client receive an
   IPvX VRP with a {Prefix, Len, Max-Len, AS} identical to one it
   already has active, it SHOULD raise a Duplicate Announcement Received
   error.

   The cache MUST merge announce/withdraw ROAs for the same {Prefix,
   Len, Max-Len, AS} into the minimal (or no) VRP to update the router
   to to the desired state.

   Strictly speaking, the only data that a router client needs from the
   Prefix is that indicated by the Prefix Length.  For example, if the
   Prefix Length is eight, then only the first eight bits of the Prefix
   are required for a router client to make use of the PDU.
   Notwithstanding this, the cache server MUST set the remaining bits of
   the Prefix to zero, for consistency with the approach used for the
   other unused components of the PDU.

   A cache sends an End of Data record to tell the router it has no more
   data for the request.

   The Session ID and Protocol Version MUST be the same as that of the
   corresponding Cache Response which began the (possibly null) sequence
   of payload PDUs.

   The Refresh Interval, Retry Interval, and Expire Interval are all
   32-bit elapsed times measured in seconds.  They express the timing
   parameters which the cache expects the router to use in deciding when
   to send subsequent Serial Query or Reset Query PDUs to the cache.
   See Section 6 for an explanation of the use and the range of allowed
   values for these parameters.

   The Router Key PDU transports they payload of a Router Key [RFC8635].

   The lowest-order bit of the Flags field is 1 for an announcement and
   0 for a withdrawal.

   The cache server MUST ensure that it has told the router client to
   have one and only one Router Key PDU for a unique {SKI, AS, Subject
   Public Key} at any one point in time.  Should the router client
   receive a Router Key PDU with a {SKI, AS, Subject Public Key}
   identical to one it already has active, it SHOULD raise a Duplicate
   Announcement Received error.

   Note that a particular AS may appear in multiple Router Key PDUs with
   different Subject Public Key values, while a particular Subject
   Public Key value may appear in multiple Router Key PDUs with
   different ASes.  In the interest of keeping the announcement and
   withdrawal semantics as simple as possible for the router, this
   protocol makes no attempt to compress either of these cases.

   Also note that it is possible, albeit very unlikely, for multiple
   distinct Subject Public Key values to hash to the same SKI.  For this
   reason, implementations MUST compare Subject Public Key values as
   well as SKIs when detecting duplicate PDUs.

   As the Subject Public Key Info is a variable length field, it must be
   decoded to determine where the PDU terminates.

   This PDU is used by either party to report an error to the other.

   Error reports are only sent as responses to other PDUs, not to report
   errors in Error Report PDUs.

   Error codes are described in Section 12.

   The Erroneous PDU field is a binary copy of the PDU causing the error
   condition, including all fields.

   If the error is generic (e.g., "Internal Error") and not associated
   with the PDU to which it is responding, the Erroneous PDU field MUST
   be empty and the Length of Encapsulated PDU field MUST be zero.

   An Error Report PDU MUST NOT be sent for an Error Report PDU.  If an
   erroneous Error Report PDU is received, the session SHOULD be
   dropped.

   If the entire erroneous PDU will not fit in the Erroneous PDU field,
   it MUST be truncated.  At a minimum, the first four octets MUST be
   included.  Beware any attempts to parse an Erroneous PDU.

   The Arbitrary Text field is optional; if not present, the Length of
   Arbitrary text field MUST be zero.  If Arbitrary Text is present, it
   MUST be a string in UTF-8 encoding (see [RFC3629]) in the Queen's
   English.

   The ASPA PDU supports [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile].

   The Customer Autonomous System Number is the 32-bit Autonomous System
   Number of the customer which authenticated the ASPA RPKI data.

   There are zero or more 32-bit Provider Autonomous System Number
   fields in increasing numeric order.  See
   [I-D.ietf-sidrops-aspa-profile].

   The Flags field is as described in Section 5.

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


   The router MUST see at most one ASPA from a particular cache for a
   particular Customer Autonomous System Number active at any time.  As
   a number of conditions in the global RPKI may present multiple valid
   ASPA RPKI records for a single customer to a particular RP cache,
   this places a burden on the cache to form the union of multiple ASPA
   records it has received from the global RPKI into one ASPA PDU.

   Receipt of an ASPA PDU announcement (announce/withdraw flag == 1)
   when the router already has an ASPA PDU with the same Customer
   Autonomous System Number from that cache replaces the previous one.
   The cache MUST deliver the complete data of an ASPA record in a
   single ASPA PDU.

   For the ASPA PDU, the announce/withdraw Flag is set to 1 to indicate
   either the announcement of a new ASPA record or a replacement for a
   previously announced record from that cache with the same Customer
   Autonomous System Number.  For an announcement, the PDU MUST contain
   at least one Provider Autonomous System Number or an Error PDU with
   code 9, ASPA Provider List Error is returned.  An ASPA announcement
   PDU containing multiple Provider Autonomous System Numbers MUST NOT
   contain AS 0 or an Error PDU with code 9 is returned.

   If the announce/withdraw flag is set to 0, the entire ASPA record
   from that cache for that Customer AS MUST be removed from the router.
   In this case, the customer AS of the ASPA record MUST be provided,
   there MUST be no Provider list, and the PDU Length MUST be 12.

6.  Protocol Timing Parameters

   Since the data the cache distributed via the RPKI-Router protocol are
   retrieved from the Global RPKI system at intervals which are only
   known to the cache, only the cache can really know how frequently it
   makes sense for the router to poll the cache, or how long the data
   are likely to remain valid (or, at least, not significantly changed).
   For this reason, as well as to allow the cache some control over the
   load placed on it by its client routers, the End Of Data PDU includes
   three values that allow the cache to communicate timing parameters to
   the router:

   Refresh Interval:  This parameter tells the router how long to wait
      before next attempting to poll the cache and between subsequent
      attempts, using a Serial Query or Reset Query PDU.  The router
      SHOULD NOT poll the cache sooner than indicated by this parameter.
      Note that receipt of a Serial Notify PDU overrides this interval
      and suggests that the router issue an immediate query without
      waiting for the Refresh Interval to expire.  Countdown for this
      timer starts upon receipt of the containing End Of Data PDU.

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


      Minimum allowed value:  1 second.

      Maximum allowed value:  86400 seconds (1 day).

      Recommended default:  3600 seconds (1 hour).

   Retry Interval:  This parameter tells the router how long to wait
      before retrying a failed Serial Query or Reset Query.  The router
      SHOULD NOT retry sooner than indicated by this parameter.  Note
      that a protocol version mismatch overrides this interval: if the
      router needs to downgrade to a lower protocol version number, it
      MAY send the first Serial Query or Reset Query immediately.
      Countdown for this timer starts upon failure of the query and
      restarts after each subsequent failure until a query succeeds.

      Minimum allowed value:  1 second.

      Maximum allowed value:  7200 seconds (2 hours).

      Recommended default:  600 seconds (10 minutes).

   Expire Interval:  This parameter tells the router how long it can
      continue to use the current version of the data while unable to
      perform a successful subsequent query.  The router MUST NOT retain
      the data past the time indicated by this parameter.  Countdown for
      this timer starts upon receipt of the containing End Of Data PDU.

      Minimum allowed value:  600 seconds (10 minutes).

      Maximum allowed value:  172800 seconds (2 days).

      Recommended default:  7200 seconds (2 hours).

   If the router has never issued a successful query against a
   particular cache, it SHOULD retry periodically using the default
   Retry Interval, above.

   Caches MUST set Expire Interval to a value larger than both the
   Refresh Interval and the Retry Interval.

7.  Protocol Version Negotiation

   Once a router has established a transport connection to a cache, it
   MUST attempt to open a RPKI-Router 'session' by issuing either a
   Reset Query Section 5.4) or a Serial Query (Section 5.3) with the
   highest version of this protocol the router implements in the
   Protocol Version field.  If the cache supports that version, it
   responds with a Cache Response (Section 5.5) of that version and the



Bush, et al.             Expires 11 August 2026                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


   session is considered open.

   If a cache which supports version C receives a query with Protocol
   Version Q < C, and the cache does not support versions <= Q, the
   cache MUST send an Error Report (Section 5.11) with Protocol Version
   C and Error Code 4 ("Unsupported Protocol Version") and disconnect
   the transport, as negotiation is hopeless.

   If a cache which supports version C receives a query with Protocol
   Version Q < C, and the cache can support version Q, the cache MUST
   establish the session at protocol version Q, [RFC6810] or [RFC8210],
   and respond with a Cache Response (Section 5.5) of that Protocol
   Version, Q, and the RPKI-Rtr session is considered open.

   If the the cache which supports C as its highest verion receives a
   query of version Q > C, the cache MUST send an Error Report with
   Protocol Version C and Error Code 4.  The router SHOULD send another
   query with a Protocol Version Q with Q == the version C in the Error
   Report; unless it has already failed at that version, which indicates
   a fatal error in programming of the cache which SHOULD result in
   transport termination.

   If the router requests Q == 0 and it still fails with the cache
   responding with an Error Report with Error Code 4, then the router
   MUST abort the transport connection, as negotiation is hopeless.

   In any of the downgraded combinations above, the new features of the
   higher version will not be available, and all PDUs MUST have the
   negotiated lower version number in their version fields.

   If either party receives a PDU containing an unrecognized Protocol
   Version (neither 0, 1, nor 2) during this negotiation, it MUST either
   downgrade to a known version or terminate the connection, with an
   Error Report PDU unless the received PDU is itself an Error Report
   PDU.

   The router MUST ignore any Serial Notify PDUs it might receive from
   the cache during this initial startup period, regardless of the
   Protocol Version field in the Serial Notify PDU.  Since Session ID
   and Serial Number values are specific to a particular protocol
   version, the values in the notification are not useful to the router.
   Even if these values were meaningful, the only effect that processing
   the notification would have would be to trigger exactly the same
   Reset Query or Serial Query that the router has already sent as part
   of the not-yet-complete version negotiation process, so there is
   nothing to be gained by processing Serial Notify PDUs until version
   negotiation completes.

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


   Caches SHOULD NOT send Serial Notify PDUs before version negotiation
   completes.  Routers, however, MUST handle such notifications (by
   ignoring them) for backwards compatibility with caches serving
   protocol version 0.

   Once the cache and router have agreed upon a Protocol Version via the
   negotiation process above, that version is fixed for the life of the
   session.  See Section 5.1 for a discussion of the interaction between
   Protocol Version and Session ID.

   The configured transport security, the negotiated RPKI-Rtr version,
   etc.  MAY NOT be changed once a session has been established.  If one
   side or the other wishes to try a different transport, protocol
   version, etc. they MUST terminate the transport and restart the
   entire transport and version negotiation process.

   If either party receives a PDU for a different Protocol Version once
   the above negotiation completes, that party MUST drop the session;
   unless the PDU containing the unexpected Protocol Version was itself
   an Error Report PDU, the party dropping the session SHOULD send an
   Error Report with an error code of 8 ("Unexpected Protocol Version").

8.  Protocol Sequences

   The sequences of PDU transmissions fall into four conversations as
   follows:

8.1.  Start or Restart

   Cache                         Router
     ~                             ~
     | <----- Reset Query -------- | R requests data (or Serial Query)
     |                             |
     | ----- Cache Response -----> | C confirms request
     | ------- Payload PDU ------> | C sends zero or more
     | ------- Payload PDU ------> |   IPv4 Prefix, IPv6 Prefix,
     | ------- Payload PDU ------> |   ASPA, or Router Key PDUs
     | ------- End of Data ------> | C sends End of Data
     |                             |   and sends new serial
     ~                             ~

   When a transport connection is first established, the router MUST
   send either a Reset Query or a Serial Query.  A Serial Query would be
   appropriate if the router has unexpired data from a broken session
   with the same cache and remembers the Session ID of that session, in
   which case a Serial Query containing the Session ID from the previous
   session will allow the router to bring itself up to date while
   ensuring that the Serial Numbers are commensurate and that the router



Bush, et al.             Expires 11 August 2026                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


   and cache are speaking compatible versions of the protocol.  In all
   other cases, the router lacks the necessary data for fast
   resynchronization and therefore MUST fall back to a Reset Query.

   The Reset Query sequence is also used when the router receives a
   Cache Reset, chooses a new cache, or fears that it has otherwise lost
   its way.

   See Section 7 for details on version negotiation.

   To limit the length of time a cache must keep the data necessary to
   generate incremental updates, a router MUST send either a Serial
   Query or a Reset Query periodically.  This also acts as a keep-alive
   at the application layer.  See Section 6 for details on the required
   polling frequency.

8.2.  Typical Exchange

   Cache                         Router
     ~                             ~
     | -------- Notify ----------> |  (optional)
     |                             |
     | <----- Serial Query ------- | R requests data
     |                             |
     | ----- Cache Response -----> | C confirms request
     | ------- Payload PDU ------> | C sends zero or more
     | ------- Payload PDU ------> |   IPv4 Prefix, IPv6 Prefix,
     | ------- Payload PDU ------> |   ASPA. or Router Key PDUs
     | ------- End of Data ------> | C sends End of Data
     |                             |   containing the new serial
     ~                             ~

   The cache server SHOULD send a Notify PDU with its current Serial
   Number when the cache's serial changes, with the expectation that the
   router MAY then issue a Serial Query earlier than it otherwise might.
   This is analogous to DNS NOTIFY in [RFC1996].  The cache MUST rate-
   limit Serial Notifies to no more frequently than one per minute.

   When the transport layer is up and either a timer has gone off in the
   router or the cache has sent a Notify PDU, the router queries for new
   data by sending a Serial Query, and the cache sends all data newer
   than the serial in the Serial Query.

   To limit the length of time a cache must keep old withdraws, a router
   MUST send either a Serial Query or a Reset Query periodically.  See
   Section 6 for details on the required polling frequency.

8.3.  No Incremental Update Available

   Cache                         Router
     ~                             ~
     | <------ Serial Query ------ | R requests data
     | ------- Cache Reset ------> | C cannot supply update
     |                             |   from specified serial
     | <------ Reset Query ------- | R requests new data
     | ----- Cache Response -----> | C confirms request
     | ------- Payload PDU ------> | C sends zero or more
     | ------- Payload PDU ------> |   IPv4 Prefix, IPv6 Prefix,
     | ------- Payload PDU ------> |   ASPA, or Router Key PDUs
     | ------- End of Data ------> | C sends End of Data
     |                             |   containing the new serial
     ~                             ~

   The cache may respond to a Serial Query with a Cache Reset, informing
   the router that the cache cannot supply an incremental update from
   the Serial Number specified by the router.  This might be because the
   cache has lost state, or because the router has waited too long
   between polls and the cache has cleaned up old data that it no longer
   believes it needed, or because the cache has run out of storage space
   and had to expire some old data early.  Regardless of how this state
   arose, the cache replies with a Cache Reset to tell the router that
   it cannot honor the request.  When a router receives this, the router
   SHOULD attempt to connect to any more-preferred caches in its cache
   list.  If there are no more-preferred caches, it MUST issue a Reset
   Query and get an entire new load from the cache.

8.4.  Cache Has No Data Available

   Cache                         Router
     ~                             ~
     | <------ Serial Query ------ | R requests data
     | ---- Error Report PDU ----> | C No Data Available
     ~                             ~

   Cache                         Router
     ~                             ~
     | <------ Reset Query ------- | R requests data
     | ---- Error Report PDU ----> | C No Data Available
     ~                             ~

   The cache may respond to either a Serial Query or a Reset Query
   informing the router that the cache cannot supply any update at all.
   The most likely cause is that the cache has lost state, perhaps due
   to a restart, and has not yet recovered.  While it is possible that a
   cache might go into such a state without dropping any of its active

   sessions, a router is more likely to see this behavior when it
   initially connects and issues a Reset Query while the cache is still
   [re]building its database.

   When a router receives this kind of error, the router SHOULD attempt
   to connect to any other caches in its cache list, in preference
   order.  If no other caches are available, the router MUST issue
   periodic Reset Queries until it gets a new usable load from the
   cache; maybe once a minute or less frequently so as not to DoS the
   cache.

9.  Transport

   The transport-layer session between a router and a cache carries the
   binary PDUs in a persistent reliable session.

   To prevent cache spoofing and DoS attacks by illegitimate routers, it
   is highly desirable that the router and the cache be authenticated to
   each other.  Integrity protection for payloads is also desirable to
   protect against monkey-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.  Unfortunately,
   there is no protocol to do so on all currently used platforms.
   Therefore, as of the writing of this document, there is no mandatory-
   to-implement transport which provides authentication and integrity
   protection.

   To reduce exposure to dropped but non-terminated sessions, both
   caches and routers SHOULD enable keep-alives when available in the
   chosen transport protocol.

   Should the cache or the router experience a transport stall (e.g. the
   peer advertised a TCP RCV.WND [RFC793] [RFC9293] of zero) for longer
   than three times the Retry Interval (a la BGP's hold timer being
   three times the keepalive interval), an Error PDU 10, Transport
   Failure, should be sent and the transport session should be
   terminated.

   A cache SHOULD NOT use a separate TCP segment for each PDU, but
   rather try to pack PDUs efficiently.

   It is expected that, when the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO)
   [RFC5925] is available on all platforms deployed by operators, it
   will become the mandatory-to-implement transport.

   Caches and routers MUST implement unprotected transport over TCP
   using a port, rpki-rtr (323); see Section 14.  Operators SHOULD use
   procedural means, e.g., access control lists (ACLs), to reduce the
   exposure to authentication issues.

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


   If unprotected TCP is the transport, the cache and routers MUST be on
   the same trusted and controlled network.

   If available to the operator, caches and routers MUST use one of the
   following more protected protocols:

   *  Caches and routers SHOULD use TCP-AO transport [RFC5925] over the
      rpki-rtr port (323).

   *  Caches and routers MAY use Secure Shell version 2 (SSHv2)
      transport [RFC4252] using the normal SSH port (22).  For an
      example, see Section 9.1.

   *  Caches and routers MAY use TCP MD5 transport [RFC2385] using the
      rpki-rtr port (323) if no other protected transport is available.
      Note that TCP MD5 has been obsoleted by TCP-AO [RFC5925].

   *  Caches and routers MAY use TCP over IPsec transport [RFC4301]
      using the rpki-rtr port (323).

   *  Caches and routers MAY use Transport Layer Security (TLS)
      transport [RFC8446] using port rpki-rtr-tls (324); see Section 14.
      Conformance to [BCP195] modern cipher suites is REQUIRED.

9.1.  SSH Transport

   To run over SSH, the client router first establishes an SSH transport
   connection using the SSHv2 transport protocol, and the client and
   server exchange keys for message integrity and encryption.  The
   client then invokes the "ssh-userauth" service to authenticate the
   application, as described in the SSH authentication protocol
   [RFC4252].  Once the application has been successfully authenticated,
   the client invokes the "ssh-connection" service, also known as the
   SSH connection protocol.

   After the ssh-connection service is established, the client opens a
   channel of type "session", which results in an SSH session.

   Once the SSH session has been established, the application invokes
   the application transport as an SSH subsystem called "rpki-rtr".
   Subsystem support is a feature of SSHv2 and is not included in SSHv1.
   Running this protocol as an SSH subsystem avoids the need for the
   application to recognize shell prompts or skip over extraneous
   information, such as a system message that is sent at shell startup.

   It is assumed that the router and cache have exchanged keys out of
   band by some reasonably secured means.

   User authentication "publickey" MUST be supported; host
   authentication "hostbased" MAY be supported.  Implementations MAY
   support password authentication "password".  "None" authentication
   MUST NOT be used.  Client routers SHOULD verify the public key of the
   cache to avoid MITM attacks.

9.2.  TLS Transport

   Client routers using TLS transport MUST present client-side
   certificates to authenticate themselves to the cache in order to
   allow the cache to manage their load by rejecting connections from
   unauthorized routers.  In principle, any type of certificate and
   Certification Authority (CA) may be used; however, in general, cache
   operators will wish to create their own small-scale CA and issue
   certificates to each authorized router.  This simplifies credential
   rollover; any unrevoked, unexpired certificate from the proper CA may
   be used.

   Certificates used to authenticate client routers in this protocol
   MUST include a subjectAltName extension [RFC5280] containing one or
   more iPAddress identities; when authenticating the router's
   certificate, the cache MUST check the IP address of the TLS
   connection against these iPAddress identities and SHOULD reject the
   connection if none of the iPAddress identities match the connection.

   Routers MUST also verify the cache's TLS server certificate, using
   subjectAltName dNSName identities as described in [RFC6125], to avoid
   MITM attacks.  The rules and guidelines defined in [RFC6125] apply
   here, with the following considerations:

   *  Support for the DNS-ID identifier type (that is, the dNSName
      identity in the subjectAltName extension) is REQUIRED in rpki-rtr
      server and client implementations which use TLS.  Certification
      authorities which issue rpki-rtr server certificates MUST support
      the DNS-ID identifier type, and the DNS-ID identifier type MUST be
      present in rpki-rtr server certificates.

   *  DNS names in rpki-rtr server certificates SHOULD NOT contain the
      wildcard character "*".

   *  rpki-rtr implementations which use TLS MUST NOT use Common Name
      (CN-ID) identifiers; a CN field may be present in the server
      certificate's subject name but MUST NOT be used for authentication
      within the rules described in [RFC6125].

   *  The client router MUST set its "reference identifier" (see
      Section 6.2 of [RFC6125]) to the DNS name of the rpki-rtr cache.

9.3.  TCP MD5 Transport

   If TCP MD5 is used, implementations MUST support key lengths of at
   least 80 printable ASCII octets, per Section 4.5 of [RFC2385].
   Implementations MUST also support hexadecimal sequences of at least
   32 characters, i.e., 128 bits.

   Key rollover with TCP MD5 is problematic.  Cache servers SHOULD
   support [RFC4808].

9.4.  TCP-AO Transport

   Implementations MUST support key lengths of at least 80 printable
   ASCII octets.  Implementations MUST also support hexadecimal
   sequences of at least 32 characters, i.e., 128 bits.  Message
   Authentication Code (MAC) lengths of at least 96 bits MUST be
   supported, per Section 5.1 of [RFC5925].

   The cryptographic algorithms and associated parameters described in
   [RFC5926] MUST be supported.

10.  Router-Cache Setup

   A cache has the public authentication data for each router it is
   configured to support.

   A router may be configured to peer with a selection of caches, and a
   cache may be configured to support a selection of routers.  Each must
   have the name of, and authentication data for, each peer.  In
   addition, in a router, this list has a non-unique preference value
   for each cache.  This preference is intended to be based on
   proximity, a la RTT, not trust, preferred belief, et cetera.  The
   client router attempts to establish a session with each potential
   serving cache in preference order and then starts to load data from
   the most preferred cache to which it can connect and authenticate.
   The router's list of caches has the following elements:

   Preference:  An unsigned integer denoting the router's preference to
      connect to that cache; the lower the value, the more preferred.

   Name:  The IP address or fully qualified domain name of the cache.

   Cache Credential(s):  Any credential (such as a public key) needed to
      authenticate the cache's identity to the router.

   Router Credential(s):  Any credential (such as a private key or
      certificate) needed to authenticate the router's identity to the
      cache.

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


   Due to the distributed nature of the RPKI, caches simply cannot be
   rigorously synchronous.  A client may hold data from multiple caches
   but MUST keep the data marked as to source, as later updates MUST
   affect the correct data.

   Just as there may be more than one covering ROA from a single cache,
   there may be multiple covering ROAs from multiple caches.  The
   results are as described in [RFC6811].

   If data from multiple caches are held, implementations MUST NOT
   distinguish between data sources when performing validation of BGP
   announcements.

   When a more-preferred cache becomes available, if resources allow, it
   would be prudent for the client to start fetching from that cache.

   The router SHOULD attempt to maintain at least one set of data,
   regardless of whether it has chosen a different cache or established
   a new connection to the previous cache.

   A client MAY drop the data from a particular cache when it is fully
   in sync with one or more other caches.

   See Section 6 for details on what to do when the client is not able
   to refresh from a particular cache.

   If a client loses connectivity to a cache it is using or otherwise
   decides to switch to a new cache, it SHOULD retain the data from the
   previous cache until it has a full set of data from one or more other
   caches.  Note that this may already be true at the point of
   connection loss if the client has connections to more than one cache.

   To keep load on Global RPKI services from unnecessary peaks, it is
   recommended that caches which fetch from the Global RPKI not do so
   all at the same times, e.g., on the hour.  Choose a random time,
   perhaps the ISP's AS number modulo 60, and jitter the inter-fetch
   timing.

11.  Races, Ordering, and Transactions

   If a client applies individual PDUs as they are received from the
   cache, such that the PDUs are taken into account immediately for the
   purposes of BGP announcement validation, it is possible for a BGP
   announcement to be classified as invalid incorrectly.  This is
   because subsequent PDUs received as part of the same cache response
   would lead to the BGP announcement being classified in some other
   way.  See Section 11.1 for examples of when this might occur,
   Section 11.2 for a mandatory PDU ordering algorithm that acts to

   mitigate the effect of these race conditions on clients, and
   Section 11.3 for client implementation approaches to these problems.

11.1.  Races

11.1.1.  IPv4/IPv6 PDUs with Different Origins

   If two BGP announcements exist for a given IP prefix destination,
   each with a different origin ASN, then two IP PDUs must be issued by
   a cache for those BGP announcements to be considered valid under
   route origin validation (ROV) [RFC6483].  If a client has only one of
   those PDUs, then the BGP announcement that is validated by the other
   PDU will be considered invalid until that other PDU is received.

11.1.2.  IPv4/IPv6 PDUs for More-Specific Prefixes

   For a given BGP announcement, there may be multiple IP PDUs that
   intersect the BGP announcement's prefix.  If the client does not have
   all of these PDUs, it may classify the BGP announcement as invalid
   under ROV.  For example, consider a scenario where there is a BGP
   announcement for 192.0.2.0/25 with an origin of AS64494, an IPv4 VRP
   for 192.0.2.0/24-24 with an origin of AS64495, and an IPv4 VRP for
   192.0.2.0/25-25 with an origin of AS64494.  A client that has
   received an announcement PDU for the first VRP only will classify the
   BGP announcement as invalid.

11.1.3.  Withdrawal Before Announcement

   If one of the underlying RPKI objects is modified in such a way that
   both a withdrawal PDU and an announcement PDU will be issued, and the
   withdrawal PDU is received by the client before the announcement PDU,
   this can lead to a BGP announcement being considered invalid until
   the announcement PDU is received.  For example, consider a scenario
   where there is a BGP announcement for 192.0.2.0/25 with an origin of
   AS64494, an IPv4 VRP for 192.0.2.0/24-24 with an origin of AS64495,
   and an IPv4 VRP for 192.0.2.0/25-25 with an origin of AS64494.  If a
   client receives a withdrawal PDU for the second VRP, followed by an
   announcement PDU that acts to replace the second VRP but with a
   greater max-length, then for the time between receipt of those two
   PDUs, the BGP announcement will be classified as invalid.

11.2.  Ordering

   For a protocol version 2 session, caches MUST use the ordering
   defined in this section when sending PDUs to clients as part of a
   cache response.  Caches SHOULD use the ordering defined in this
   section for sessions using earlier protocol versions as well.  This
   is because those versions did not prescribe a specific ordering for
   PDUs, and the benefits of ordering with respect to race conditions
   are the same for those earlier versions.  An example scenario where
   an implementor would use another ordering for earlier protocol
   versions is where the implementation has an existing ordering it uses
   for those versions, and the implementor knows of clients that
   inadvertently depend on that ordering for some reason.

   The ordering definitions in this section have been modelled on those
   from Section 4.3.3 of [RFC9582].

   The ordering defined in this section is a total ordering.  While a
   partial ordering could be defined that had the same benefits as far
   as race conditions are concerned, a total ordering makes it easier
   for clients to verify that the ordering is correct, and may also
   provide opportunities for client optimisations.

   When using PDU values as integers for ordering comparisons,
   implementors should ensure that each value being used in a comparison
   is not inadvertently encoded using little-endian bit order, since
   such an encoding will lead to incorrect results.

   PDUs with a lower integer PDU type precede PDUs with a higher integer
   PDU type.  The sections that follow describe ordering as among PDUs
   of the same type.

11.2.1.  IP Prefix PDUs

   In order to semantically compare and sort IP Prefix PDUs, each PDU is
   mapped to an abstract data element comprising five integer values:

   addr  The first IP address of the IP prefix appearing in the PDU, as
      a 32-bit (IPv4) or 128-bit (IPv6) integer value.

   plen  The length of the IP prefix appearing in the PDU, as an integer
      value.

   mlen  The max length appearing in the PDU, as an integer value.

   asn  The origin ASN appearing in the PDU, as an integer value.

   updt  The integer 1, if the PDU is an announcement, and the integer

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


      0, if the PDU is a withdrawal.

   The equality or relative order of two IP Prefix PDUs can be tested by
   comparing their abstract representations.

   The first order comparison is based on the updt value.  Data elements
   with an updt value of 1 precede data elements with an updt value of
   0.  This addresses the problem described in Section 11.1.3.

   The order of two IP Prefix PDUs with updt values of 1 is determined
   by the first non-equal comparison in the following list.

   1.  Data elements with a higher addr value precede data elements with
       a lower addr value.

   2.  Data elements with a higher mlen value precede data elements with
       a lower mlen value.

   3.  Data elements with a higher plen value precede data elements with
       a lower plen value.

   4.  Data elements with a higher asn value precede data elements with
       a lower asn value.  This ensures that AS0 PDU announcements,
       which can be used to cause BGP announcements to become invalid
       under ROV, always appear after all other relevant PDU
       announcements.

   The order of two IP Prefix PDUs with updt values of 0 is determined
   by the first non-equal comparison in the following list.

   1.  Data elements with a lower addr value precede data elements with
       a higher addr value.

   2.  Data elements with a lower mlen value precede data elements with
       a higher mlen value.

   3.  Data elements with a lower plen value precede data elements with
       a higher plen value.

   4.  Data elements with a lower asn value precede data elements with a
       higher asn value.  This ensures that AS0 PDU withdrawals always
       appear before all other relevant PDU withdrawals.

   For both announcement and withdrawal PDUs, the first three
   comparisons are included so as to address the problem described in
   Section 11.1.2.

11.2.2.  Router Key PDUs

   In order to semantically compare and sort Router Key PDUs, each PDU
   is mapped to an abstract data element comprising five values:

   ski  The Subject Key Identifier appearing in the PDU, as binary data
      (20 octets in length).

   spkinfo  The Subject Public Key Info appearing in the PDU, as DER-
      encoded data.

   spkinfolen  The number of octets in spkinfo.

   asn  The ASN appearing in the PDU, as an integer value.

   updt  The integer 1, if the PDU is an announcement, and the integer
      0, if the PDU is a withdrawal.

   The equality or relative order of two Router Key PDUs can be tested
   by comparing their abstract representations.

   1.  Data elements with an updt value of 1 precede data elements with
       an updt value of 0.  This addresses the problem described in
       Section 11.1.3.

   2.  Data elements are then ordered based on their ski values.  This
       ordering is lexicographical: each octet of binary data is treated
       as a symbol to compare, with the symbols ordered by their
       numerical value.

   3.  Data elements with a lower spkinfolen value precede data elements
       with a higher spkinfolen value.

   4.  Data elements are then ordered based on their spkinfo values.
       This ordering is the same as for the ski values.

   5.  Data elements with a lower asn value precede data elements with a
       higher asn value.

11.2.3.  ASPA PDUs

   In order to semantically compare and sort ASPA PDUs, each PDU is
   mapped to an abstract data element comprising two integer values:

   casn  The customer ASN appearing in the PDU, as an integer value.

   updt  The integer 1, if the PDU is an announcement, and the integer
      0, if the PDU is a withdrawal.

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


   The equality or relative order of two ASPA PDUs can be tested by
   comparing their abstract representations.

   1.  Data elements with an updt value of 1 precede data elements with
       an updt value of 0.  This addresses the problem described in
       Section 11.1.3.

   2.  Data elements with a lower casn value precede data elements with
       a higher casn value.

11.3.  Transactions

   Clients are RECOMMENDED to apply PDUs only on receipt of an End of
   Data PDU.  This implementation approach will ensure that the client
   is unaffected by the problems described in Section 11.1.

   A client may be unable to apply PDUs only on receipt of an End of
   Data PDU, due e.g. to memory limitations.  An alternative
   implementation approach that a client can use is to apply IP Prefix
   PDUs as a single group if their prefixes are equal.  Since the
   mandatory ordering is such that those PDUs will appear in sequence,
   and such groups will generally be small, this should be easier for
   clients to support.  A client that implements this approach is safe
   with respect to all of the problems described in Section 11.1.

   A client that is unable to apply PDUs only on receipt of an End of
   Data PDU, and also unable to implement the alternative implementation
   approach described in this section, will be at risk of encountering
   the problems described in Section 11.1.  While such problems will
   generally be transient, because a subsequent PDU received during the
   same synchronisation attempt should act to rectify the problem, there
   is a risk that those PDUs are not received due to an error during the
   synchronisation attempt.  In that scenario, clients SHOULD revert the
   application of any PDUs received during the failed synchronisation
   attempt.

11.4.  Other Considerations

   A client that applies PDUs transactionally (e.g. on receipt of an End
   of Data PDU) SHOULD consider limiting the period of time for which it
   will wait for the PDU that will close the transaction.  This is
   especially important when initiating or resetting a session, since it
   may take some time to receive all relevant data from the cache.

   A client MAY verify the ordering of PDUs, and when an ordering error
   is encountered, send an Ordering Error PDU to the server and
   terminate the session.  However, given that ordering issues lead only
   to transient problems, and also that resetting the session with the

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


   same cache is unlikely to fix the problem, clients should consider
   whether terminating the session is worthwhile.  For example, if
   another cache is available, that may weigh in favour of terminating
   the current session and switching to that other cache.

   Section 11.1 describes various scenarios where immediate application
   of PDUs can cause problems, depending on the order in which they are
   returned.  A related problem is where an RPKI CA operator makes non-
   atomic changes to RPKI objects in such a way that the same ordering
   problem occurs, due to the cache receiving the updates at different
   times.  However, RPKI CAs are able to make groups of changes take
   effect atomically, so in the common case where this problem arises,
   it will be due to limitations in CA implementations.  Even in a case
   where a group of changes cannot be made to take effect atomically, it
   will be possible to order the changes at the CA such that no problems
   occur.  For example, the operator could add a new ROA prior to
   removing an old ROA, allowing enough time between the operations that
   the risk of a cache or a client receiving both updates at the same
   time is low.

   Related to the previous paragraph is the scenario where RPKI objects
   that need to be ordered in a specific way are issued by separate CAs.
   As with non-atomic operations by a single CA, CA operators in this
   situation must co-ordinate so as to ensure that the operations are
   ordered correctly and that there is sufficient time between the
   operations.  CA operators in this situation should consider managing
   all such RPKI objects within a single CA, though, to avoid the
   problems that arise here.

   A client that is generally unable to apply PDUs only on receipt of an
   End of Data PDU should consider whether it is possible to implement
   that behaviour at least in the context of new session initiation and
   session reset.  Doing so will limit the risk of BGP announcements
   being used for a short period of time before being rejected due to
   the receipt of an invalidating PDU.

12.  Error Codes

   This section describes the meaning of the error codes.  There is an
   IANA registry where valid error codes are listed; see [iana-err].
   Errors which are considered fatal MUST cause the session to be
   dropped, and the router MUST flush all data learned from that cache.

   0: Corrupt Data (fatal):  The receiver believes the received PDU to
      be corrupt in a manner not specified by another error code.

   1: Internal Error (fatal):  The party reporting the error experienced

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


      some kind of internal error unrelated to protocol operation (ran
      out of memory, a coding assertion failed, et cetera).

   2: No Data Available (non-fatal):  The cache believes itself to be in
      good working order but is unable to answer either a Serial Query
      or a Reset Query because it has no useful data available at this
      time.  This is likely to be a temporary error and most likely
      indicates that the cache has not yet completed pulling down an
      initial current data set from the Global RPKI system after some
      kind of event that invalidated whatever data it might have
      previously held (reboot, network partition, et cetera).

   3: Invalid Request (fatal):  The cache server believes the client's
      request to be invalid.

   4: Unsupported Protocol Version (non-fatal):  The Protocol Version is
      not known by the receiver of the PDU.  A session is not
      [re-]established, but data previously learned need not be flushed.

   5: Unsupported PDU Type (fatal):  The PDU Type is not known by the
      receiver of the PDU.

   6: Withdrawal of Unknown Record (fatal):  The received PDU has
      Flag=0, but a matching record ({Prefix, Len, Max-Len, AS} tuple
      for an IPvX PDU, or {SKI, AS, Subject Public Key} tuple for a
      Router Key PDU), or Customer Autonomous System for an ASPA PDU
      does not exist in the receiver's database.

   7: Duplicate Announcement Received (fatal):  The received PDU has
      Flag=1, but a matching record ({Prefix, Len, Max-Len, AS} tuple
      for an IPvX PDU, or {SKI, AS, Subject Public Key} tuple for a
      Router Key PDU), or Customer Autonomous System for an ASPA PDU is
      already active in the router.

   8: Unexpected Protocol Version (fatal):  The received PDU has a
      Protocol Version field that differs from the protocol version
      negotiated in Section 7.

   9: ASPA Provider List Error (fatal):  The received ASPA PDU has an
      incorrect list of Provider Autonomous System Numbers.

   10: Transport Error (fatal):  An error such as a stall (see
      Section 9) or other transport layer failure occurred.

   11: Ordering Error (fatal):  The received PDU does not conform with
      the ordering defined in Section 11.2.

13.  Security Considerations

   As this document describes a security protocol, many aspects of
   security interest are described in the relevant sections.  This
   section points out issues which may not be obvious in other sections.

   Cache Peer Identification:  The router initiates a transport
      connection to a cache, which it identifies by either IP address or
      fully qualified domain name.  Be aware that a DNS or address
      spoofing attack could make the correct cache unreachable.  No
      session would be established, as the authorization keys would not
      match.

   Cache Validation:  In order for a collection of caches to provide a
      consistent view, they need to be given consistent trust anchors of
      the Certification Authorities to use in their internal validation
      process.  Distribution of a consistent trust anchor set to
      validating caches is assumed to be out of band or specified
      elsewhere.

   Transport Security:  The RPKI relies on object, not server or
      transport, security.  Trust anchor(s) are distributed to all
      caches through an out-of-band mechanism specified elsewhere.  This
      can then be used by each cache to validate signed objects all the
      way up the tree.  The inter-cache relationships are based on this
      object security model; hence, any inter-cache transport can be
      lightly protected.

      However, this protocol assumes that the routers cannot do the
      validation cryptography.  Hence, the last link, from cache to
      router, SHOULD be secured by server authentication and transport-
      level security to prevent monkey in the middle attacks; though it
      might not be.  Not using transport security is dangerous, as
      server authentication and transport have very different threat
      models than object security.

      So the strength of the trust relationship and the transport
      between the router(s) and the cache(s) are critical.  You're
      betting your routing on this.

      While we cannot say the cache must be on the same LAN, if only due
      to the issue of an enterprise wanting to offload the cache task to
      their upstream ISP(s), locality, trust, and control are very
      critical issues here.  The cache(s) really SHOULD be as close, in
      the sense of controlled and protected (against DDoS, MITM)
      transport, to the router(s) as possible.  It also SHOULD be
      topologically close so that a minimum of validated routing data
      are needed to bootstrap a router's access to a cache.



Bush, et al.             Expires 11 August 2026                [Page 39]

Internet-Draft            RPKI-Router Protocol             February 2026


      Authenticating transport protocols (i.e. not raw TCP) will
      authenticate the identity of the cache server to the router
      client, and vice versa, before any data are exchanged.

      Transports which cannot provide the necessary authentication and
      integrity (see Section 9) must rely on network design and
      operational controls to provide protection against spoofing/
      corruption attacks.  As pointed out in Section 9, TCP-AO is the
      long-term plan.  Protocols which provide integrity and
      authenticity SHOULD be used, and if they cannot, i.e., TCP is used
      as the transport, the router and cache MUST be on the same
      trusted, controlled network.

14.  IANA Considerations

   This section only discusses updates required in the existing IANA
   protocol registries to accommodate version 2 of this protocol.  See
   [RFC8210] for IANA considerations of the previous (version 1)
   protocol.

   All of the PDU types in the IANA "rpki-rtr-pdu" registry [iana-pdu]
   in protocol versions 0 and 1 are also allowed in protocol version 2,
   with the addition of the new ASPA PDU.

   The "rpki-rtr-error: registry [iana-err] should be updated as
   follows:

             Error
             Code    Description
             -----   ----------------
                 0   Corrupt Data
                 1   Internal Error
                 2   No Data Available
                 3   Invalid Request
                 4   Unsupported Protocol Version
                 5   Unsupported PDU Type
                 6   Withdrawal of Unknown Record
                 7   Duplicate Announcement Received
                 8   Unexpected Protocol Version
                 9   ASPA Provider List Error
                10   Transport Failure
                11   Ordering Error
            11-254   Unassigned
               255   Reserved

   The "rpki-rtr-pdu" registry [iana-pdu] has been updated as follows:

15.  Implementation status

   This section is to be removed before publishing as an RFC.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [RFC7942].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [RFC7942], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".
